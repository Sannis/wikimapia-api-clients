Wikimapia API clients
=====================

[Wikimapia.org] gives you an extensive set of functions that can be used in your websites and applications for accumulated geographic data.

All data that is available to you through the API are open and accessible to non-commercial use.

The [Wikimapia API] allows client applications or websites to view map data that stored in our database.

Some examples:

 * A module to display additional information about objects in GPS-navigate tool
 * A website of historical places (see our news about historical layer!)
 * A mobile application for tourists visiting other countries and towns

The Wikimapia API Supports all most popular formats: XML, JSON, JSON-P, KML, Serialize, Binary.

This project was created in order to facilitate your work with the API and give the opportunity to immediately use it
without first thinking about the implementation of the connection to API.

In sources you can find client libraries for PHP, JavaScript (using MooTools), Node.js, Java and C#.

Feel free to report bugs or fork & improve it!
