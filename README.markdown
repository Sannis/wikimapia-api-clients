Overview
--------

[Wikimapia.org] gives you a set of functions that can be used in your websites and applications
for accumulated geographic data.

All data that is available to you through the API are open
and accessible under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.

The Wikimapia API allows client applications or websites to view map data that stored in the Wikimapia database.

This project was created in order to facilitate your work with the API and give the opportunity to immediately use it
without first thinking about the implementation of the connection to API.
